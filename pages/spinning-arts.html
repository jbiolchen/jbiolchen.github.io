      <p>
        I started my spinning arts journey at MIT in 2017. As an undergrad, I served as president of the MIT Spinning Arts Club, and as an alum I occasionally assist with fire safety trainings and other club events. I mostly spin rope dart and poi, and I dabble in fire-eating, breathing, and fleshing (moves in which fuel is intentionally transferred onto bare skin).
      <p>
        Here are some of my current interests and aspirations:
        <ul>
           <li>Dart: non-stall dark plane tech, contact pirouettes</li>
           <li>Poi: transitions into and out of 2poi1hand, 2poi1hand moves (specifically flowers, Mercedes), gunslingers</li>
           <li>Eating/fleshing: lighting second torch off of a candle, 1-handed jumping jellyfish</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Flow artists can find photos and videos on Instagram of what I'm currently working on, and everyone can find footage of my old performances on the MIT Spinning Arts Club's YouTube channel.

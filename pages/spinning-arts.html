      <p>
        I started my spinning arts journey at MIT in 2017. As an undergrad, I served as president of the MIT Spinning Arts Club, and as an alum I occasionally assist with fire safety trainings and other club events. I mostly spin rope dart and poi, and I dabble in fire-eating and breathing.

        More to come...

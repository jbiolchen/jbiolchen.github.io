      <p>
        I am currently collaborating with my friend <a href="https://audreycui.github.io/" class="bold green">Audrey Cui</a> on a custom pair of Damascus steel wedding bands for another friend of mine and her husband. More details forthcoming, once we have <h class="ital">iron</h>ed out the details of our surface finish protocol.</li>
      <p>
        Would you also rather skip the jewelry store and instead wear a wedding ring made in a university basement by a machinist-in-training (Audrey) and machinist-in-training-by-a-machinist-in-training (me)? Email us at <a href="mailto:damascussy@mit.edu">damascussy@mit.edu</a>! Friends, family, and advisors discount available.

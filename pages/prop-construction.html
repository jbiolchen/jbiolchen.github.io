      <p>
        I have been experimenting with fire prop construction for several years, including briefly in a professional capacity at Dark Monk, a small business based in Salem, MA. I custom-built all of the fire and glow equipment that I use, some completely from scratch and others incorporating commercially available products. Feel free to reach out with questions, especially if you are a college student! Safety is my passion and budget constraints are my familiarity.
      <p>
        More to come.

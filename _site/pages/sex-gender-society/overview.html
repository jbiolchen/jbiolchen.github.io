   <h1 class="left">Some Scholarly Thoughts on Sex and Gender</h1>
   <p>
     I have worked on a variety of research topics that no longer align with the NIH mission as it is currently being redefined by the second Trump administration. I am making my nonsensitive writings and reference documents available here, in a personal capacity:
     <ul>
        <li><a href="/assets/nonconstructive-sex_v3.pdf">"The Trump Adminstration has Concepts of a Sex"</a>: a short piece on the logical and practical flaws in the definition of biological sex laid out in Executive Order #14168, to which NIH is currently beholden</li>
        <!-- <li>The Asymmetric Politics of Defining Biological Sex</li> -->
     </ul>

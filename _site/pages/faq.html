      <h1 class="left">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h4 class="left">Why is your GitHub username <h class="ital">jbiolchen</h>?</h4>
      <p>
        It's a play on words combining <h class="ital">J. Biol. Chem.</h>, the abbreviation for the Journal of Biological Chemistry, and my last name. I made this account back in high school for my AP Computer Science class. Back then I thought I was going to be a biochemist and I also thought I was funny. Now I still think I'm funny, but I have a lot of other interests too!

Doob's Measure Theory graduate text in mathematics"></td><td><p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be J.L. Doob's <b><i>Measure Theory</i></b>.</p><p>I am different from other books on measure theory in that I accept probability theory as an essential part of measure theory. This means that many examples are taken from probability; that probabilistic concepts such as independence, Markov processes, and conditional expectations are integrated into me rather than being relegated to an appendix; that more attention is paid to the role of algebras than is customary; and that the metric defining the distance between sets as the measure of their symmetric difference is exploited more than is customary. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be? <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>

      <h1 class="left">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h4 class="left">Why is your GitHub username <h class="ital">jbiolchen</h>?</h4>
      <p>
        It's a play on words combining <h class="ital">J. Biol. Chem.</h>, the abbreviation for the Journal of Biological Chemistry, and my last name. I made this account back in high school for my AP Computer Science class. Back then I thought I was going to be a biochemist and I also thought I was funny. Now I still think I'm funny, but I have a lot of other interests too!

Doob's Measure Theory graduate text in mathematics"></td><td><p>If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be J.L. Doob's <b><i>Measure Theory</i></b>.</p><p>I am different from other books on measure theory in that I accept probability theory as an essential part of measure theory. This means that many examples are taken from probability; that probabilistic concepts such as independence, Markov processes, and conditional expectations are integrated into me rather than being relegated to an appendix; that more attention is paid to the role of algebras than is customary; and that the metric defining the distance between sets as the measure of their symmetric difference is exploited more than is customary. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be? <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>

      <h4 class="left">What Arctic Fox semi-permanent hair dye colors would you recommend?</h4>
      <p>
        (NOT sponsored! Just my personal opinion based on ~8 years of experience with bleaching and dyeing my own hair in the bathroom. Arctic Fox is the only brand I use because it gave out lots of free samples at my undergrad institution, so it was the first dye I ever used and I continue to like it.)
      <p>
        I prefer very vibrant, heavily pigmented dyes that last for months with cold showers. I would therefore recommend Purple AF (formerly Purple Rain), Aquamarine, Cosmic Sunshine (I mix this with other colors to make shades of green and orange), Poison, and Wrath. I would NOT recommend Poseidon, as I have found it to be a very weak dye even though its packaging and example photos make it look otherwise.

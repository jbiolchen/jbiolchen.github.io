      <h1 class="left">Damascus Stainless Steel Projects</h1>
      <p>
        I am collaborating with my friend <a href="https://audreycui.github.io/" class="keyword">Audrey Cui</a> on a variety of projects involving Damascus steel. We are using austenitic 304L/316L stainless steel stock from Damasteel, which is intended for jewelry and decorative pieces.

      <h4 class="left">Rings (completed April 2025)</h4>
      <p>
        We created a custom pair of Damascus steel wedding bands for a friend of mine and her husband. Since this was our first time lathing steel, we prototyped the rings in 316 stainless, which is relatively harder to machine.
      <p>
        In consultation with the happy couple, we designed a pair of relatively low-profile rings suitable for everyday wear and light manual work. We created a slightly curved exterior contour and a "comfort fit" curved interior contour using the lathe's CNC function. The resulting surface finish was quite rough due to tool chatter. We sanded each ring with progressively finer sandpaper (from 80 grit up to 1000 grit) before polishing it with 1200 grit silicone carbide.
      <p>
        Once the rings were polished and cleaned, we etched them with an aqueous FeCl<sub>2</sub>/HCl solution of unknown molarity on a 45 C hot plate for 4 to 5 minutes to reveal the Damascus pattern. The etched portions of the surface have a matte texture but are not recessed below the unetched portions.

        Would you also rather skip the jewelry store and instead wear a wedding ring made in a university basement by a machinist-in-training (Audrey) and machinist-in-training-by-a-machinist-in-training (me)?

      <p>
        Part of the appeal of creating Damascus wedding bands for the happy couple was being able to create custom Damascus rings for ourselves with the leftover stock. My ring design was loosely inspired by the MIT Brass Rat, with an angled exterior profile and a flat interior profile. This ring also serves a function analogous to that of the Brass Rat by 1) reminding me of what my friends and I can achieve together, and 2) helping motivate me to complete my PhD.
      <p>
        Since my design had no curved profiles, I was able to machine the entire ring manually (using the chamfer function for the exterior profile) and had a relatively good surface finish right off the bat, so I didn't bother sanding/polishing the outside. I learned while creating the 316 stainless prototype that the standard bore tool for the lathe creates a lot of chatter (small vibrations) because steel is so hard, resulting in a striated interior profile that is difficult to smooth out with sandpaper alone. I find this texture kind of fun, but Damascus patterns look much cleaner on a smooth surface, so for the Damascus ring I used a larger (i.e. stiffer) bore tool to minimize chatter.
      <p>
        This photo was taken after a couple months of wearing the 316 SS ring daily and right after etching the Damascus ring:

      <p>
        Both alloys are noticeably more scratch-resistant than the "Ultrium" alloy used in stainless steel Brass Rats.

      <h4 class="left">Keychains (completed April 2025)</h4>
      <p>
        I designed a Damascus keychain ornament that accommodates disc-shaped inserts. In the example below, we chose acrylic for the insert material because it comes in a lot of fun colors, is easy to work with on the laser cutter, is waterproof, and already exists abundantly in Audrey's personal stash of leftover materials from other projects. Since acrylic is quite brittle, my hope is that using the Damascus as the main structural and impact-absorbing component will help prevent breakage.
      <p>
        We machined the ornaments using the same techniques we used for the rings. For the inserts, I referenced (with permission from the photographer) a photo of a cicada with a rare genetic mutation affecting eye color. I wanted to laser-engrave the photo onto the inserts but felt that the keychains would be too small to render the fine details legible, so I used Procreate on Audrey's iPad to trace a simplified version of the cicada for engraving.

        Finally, I etched the Damascus using Klean-Strip concrete cleaner from Home Depot (which appears to be a dilute HCl solution) at ambient outdoor temperature (~50 C). After three 20-minute rounds of etching, the resulting finish looked quite similar to the finish on the rings. Here are the reference photo and final product:

      </div>

      <p>
        The ornament fits on a 1" binder ring, which can then be clipped to a bag, keychain, etc. The acrylic insert is secured to the Damascus with a small piece of tape, so it can be removed to swap it out for a different color insert or to re-etch the Damascus. This ornament will be finding its way into the hands of the cicada photographer who generously donated their work to the cause.

      <h4 class="left">Works in Progress</h4>
      <p>
        We are experimenting with different acid solutions to create deeper, more scratch-resistant etches. We are also interested in sandblasting, heat-treating, or electroplating Damascus steel to try to create more interesting surface finishes.

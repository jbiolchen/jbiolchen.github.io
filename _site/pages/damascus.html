      <h1 class="left">Damascus Steel Projects</h1>
      <p>
      I am collaborating with my friend <a href="https://audreycui.github.io/" class="keyword">Audrey Cui</a> on a variety of projects involving Damascus steel.

      <h4 class="left">Wedding Bands</h4>
      <p>
        We are creating a custom pair of Damascus steel wedding bands for another friend of mine and her husband. For this project, we chose an austenitic 304L/316L stainless steel alloy from Damasteel, which is intended for jewelry and decorative pieces. Since this was our first time working with steel, we prototyped the rings in 316 stainless, which is relatively harder to machine.
      <p>
        In consultation with the happy couple, we designed a pair of relatively low-profile rings suitable for everyday wear and light manual work. We created a slightly curved exterior contour and a "comfort fit" curved interior contour using a CNC lathe. The resulting surface finish was quite rough, so we sanded each ring with progressively finer sandpaper (from 80 grit up to 1000 grit) before polishing it with a Dremel.
      <p>
        <!-- Once the rings were polished and cleaned, we etched them with an acid solution to reveal the Damascus pattern. -->
        We will soon etch the rings with an acid solution to reveal the Damascus pattern.

        Would you also rather skip the jewelry store and instead wear a wedding ring made in a university basement by a machinist-in-training (Audrey) and machinist-in-training-by-a-machinist-in-training (me)?

      <h4 class="left">Machinist Rings</h4>
      <p>
        Part of the appeal of creating Damascus wedding bands for the happy couple was being able to create custom Damascus rings for ourselves with the leftover stock. My ring design was loosely inspired by the MIT Brass Rat, with an angled exterior profile and a flat interior profile. Also like my Brass Rat, this ring is intended to 1) remind me of what my friends and I can achieve together, and 2) help motivate me to complete my PhD.
      <p>
        Since my design had no curved profiles, I was able to machine the entire ring manually (using the chamfer function for the exterior profile) and had a relatively good surface finish right off the bat. I learned while creating the 316 stainless prototype that the standard bore tool for the lathe creates a lot of chatter (small vibrations) because steel is so hard, resulting in a striated interior profile that is difficult to smooth out with sandpaper alone. I find this texture kind of fun, but Damascus patterns look much cleaner on a smooth surface, so I will reconfigure the bore tool to minimize chatter when I machine the actual Damascus ring.

      <h4 class="left">Potential Future Directions</h4>
      <p>
        We are also interested in sandblasting, heat-treating, or electroplating Damascus steel to try to create more interesting surface finishes.

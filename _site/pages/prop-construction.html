   <h1 class="left">Spinning Arts Prop Construction</h1>
      <p>
        I have been experimenting with fire prop construction for several years, including briefly in a professional capacity at Dark Monk, a small business based in Salem, MA. I custom-built all of the fire and glow equipment that I use, some completely from scratch and others incorporating commercially available products. Feel free to reach out with questions, especially if you are a college student! Safety is my passion and budget constraints are my familiarity.

      <ul>
         <li>Dart leash material: 3/16" Technora</li>
         <li>Poi leash material: 3/16" Technora with splice tail going all the way through</li>
         <li>Contact staff construction: three-piece breakdown glow staff</li>
      </ul>
    <h4 class="left">Aquapoirin Project (in progress)</h4>
       <p>
         This is a collaboration with <a href="https://audreycui.github.io/" class="keyword">Audrey Cui</a> whose aim is to custom-modify commercially available poi knob handles to add an internal bearing. This bearing replaces the swivel that would otherwise be necessary to make poi leashes that can perform orbitals, which eliminates the need to add a handle-side splice and creates a uniformly stiff leash.
       <p>
         I designed and Audrey fabricated (aluminum, manual lathe) an initial prototype that fits the Flowtoys 6 mm Uni knob and a 608ZZ bearing, and works well with leash diameters up to about 8 mm. We are now working on a glow version that includes a custom printed circuit board and two LEDs.
